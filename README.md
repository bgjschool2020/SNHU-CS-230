## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a game company, they want to expand Draw It or Lose It, their current Android game, to several
platforms by porting it to a web-based game.
## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe I did a fair job of describing the requirements section of this document.
## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The UML was very useful for developing. It made it much easier to utilize OOP in the correct way.
## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I would redo the Design Constraints section of the document. I don't think it is very detailed and it could definitely be elaborated upon.
## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Condidering the user's needs is super important in software. They will be using it, making it exceptionally difficult to use it effectively makes it pointless.
## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
